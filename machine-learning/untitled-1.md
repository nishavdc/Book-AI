# Supervised Learning

* Teaching the model with labelled data.

### Types of supervised learning

1. Classification

### Regression:

A regression model relates y, or the dependent variable, to a function of x, i.e., the independent variables.

Two types of variables:

* Dependent variables\(y\)
  * The dependent variable can be seen as the "state", "target" or "final goal" we study and try to predict.
  * Should be a continuous value and cannot be a discrete value.
* Independent variables\(x\)

  * independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the "causes" of those "states".
  * Can be measured on a categorical or continuous data

The objective of linear regression is to minimize this MSE equation, and to minimize it, we should find the best parameters, θ0 and θ1.
