# Introduction

## Introduction

* In case where we need to diagnose if a tumor is benign or malignant, clean the data, select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model, and train the model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data.
* Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict new or unknown cell with rather a high accuracy. This is machine learning.
* Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.‚Äù -Artur Samuel

### Major machine learning techniques:

* Regression/Estimation
  * Predicting continuous values
* Classification
  * Predicting the item class/category of a case
* Clustering
  * Finding the structure of data
* Associations
  * Associating frequent co-occurring items/events
* Anomaly detection
  * discovering abnormal and unusual cases
* Sequence mining
  * Predicting next events; click-stream\(Markov model, HMM\)
* Dimension Reduction
  * Reducing the size of data\(PCA\)
* Recommendation systems
  * Recommending items
