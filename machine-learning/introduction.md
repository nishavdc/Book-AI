## Introduction

* In case where we need to diagnose if a tumor is benign or malignant, clean the data, select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model, and train the model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data.
* Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict new or unknown cell with rather a high accuracy. This is machine learning.
* Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.‚Äù -Artur Samuel
