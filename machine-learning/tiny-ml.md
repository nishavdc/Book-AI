# Tiny ML

TinyML, or tiny machine learning, is a fast-growing field of machine learning technologies and applications that include algorithms, hardware, and software that are capable of performing on-device sensor data analytics, doing so at extremely low power, typically in the order of milliwatts, so that we can enable always-on machine learning use cases on battery-powered devices.

> Example: Elephant Edge program
