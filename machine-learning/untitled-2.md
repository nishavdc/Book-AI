# Unsupervised Learning

* The model works on its own to discover information.
* unlabeled data is fed as input.

### Unsupervised learning techniques:

* Dimensionality reduction
  * reduce redundant features
* Density estimation
  * explore data to find some structure within it
* Market basket analysis
* Clustering
  * grouping data points or objects that are similar.

## Clustering

* A cluster is group of data points or objects in a dataset that are similar to other objects in the group, and dissimilar to data points in other clusters.

### **Hierarchical Clustering**

* Hierarchical clustering algorithms build a hierarchy of clusters where each node is a cluster consisting of the clusters of its daughter nodes.
