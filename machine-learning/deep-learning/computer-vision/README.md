## Advantages of Deep Learning

* **Automatic Feature Extraction**: features can be automatically learned and extracted from raw image data
* **End-to-End Models:** Single end-to-end models can replace pipelines of specialized models.
* **Model Reuse:** Learned features and even entire models can be reused across tasks.
* **Superior Performance**: Techniques demonstrate better skill on challenging tasks.
* **Promise of General Method:** A single general method can be used on a range of related tasks.
